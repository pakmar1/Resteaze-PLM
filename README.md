# RestEaze

RestEaZe<sup>TM</sup> is a sleep monitoring system designed with the goal to overcome the
cost and convenience issues faced in a sleep lab study. It is an affordable product
and service that patients can take home and use in their natural sleep setting. The
system tracks the leg movements made by the patient during the night and translates
them to a sleep quality measure based on specific types of movements identified by
sleep science laboratories.

RestEaZe<sup>TM</sup> is made of three pillars.
1. Wearable Ankle Bands
2. Mobile Application
3. Back End System
